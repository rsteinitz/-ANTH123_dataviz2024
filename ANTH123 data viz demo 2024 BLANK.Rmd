## Welcome! 
This tutorial 

For more beginner-level examples, go to:
https://r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html

for more on the {sf} package:
https://r-spatial.org/r/2017/01/12/newssf.html

for more general R-spatial stuff: https://r-spatial.org/

R has been used for the analysis of spatial data since the early days of R.

### Attach packages
```{r attach packages}

# Wrangling
library(tidyverse) # does everything
library(plyr) # for some wrangling

# Plotting
library(RColorBrewer)
library(patchwork)

# Spatial
library(ggmap) # package that can get coordinates of locations and retrieves map tiles from popular online mapping services like Google Maps
library(spData) # small geographic data sets; some world data
# To access larger datasets in this package, install the spDataLarge package with: `install.packages('spDataLarge', repos='https://nowosad.github.io/drat/', type='source')`
library(sf) # create sf; extends data.frame-like objects with a simple feature list column
library(tmap) # use this for mapping; # lots to install here, sorry, but it's worth it.
# before installing tmap, do Tools --> Check for package updates and install all updates
library(tmaptools) # use this for geocoding cities using OSM instead of Google (which requires API)

```


### Plotting like a pro
#### Load some data
More info on this dataset here (courtesy of the Smithsonian Inst. via TidyTuesday) https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-05-12
--> you can look up what each column means; e.g., "tectonic_settings" means "Plate tectonic settings (subduction, intraplate, rift zone) + crust" 
```{r}

# reading in TidyTuesday data from website 
volcano <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/volcano.csv')
eruptions <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/eruptions.csv')
events <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-12/events.csv')

```

#### Wrangle data
```{r}

# First, we want to become familiar with that data

# -----let's look at the data-----



# -----some adjustments-----



# -----summarize the data-----







# what did I get from this new, summarized dataset?

```

#### Let's try some plotting
```{r}

# -----dealing with NAs-----




# -----filtering or sampling dataset-----




# -----arranging-----



# -----plotting-----
# (see below for cheat :)


# you can also order a discrete axis by a continuous variable!
# in this case, I made the y axis still volcano name, but I want them arranged by first year
# so first, I re-arrange the dataset
erupt_ordered_year <- erupt_short %>% 
  arrange(first_year)

# and then plot with special instructions in the aesthetics of geom_segment, and in scale_y_discrete
ggplot(erupt_ordered_year) +
  
  geom_segment(aes(x = first_year, y = reorder(volcano_name, sort(first_year)), xend = last_year, yend = reorder(volcano_name, sort(first_year)), color = years_active), size = 3) +
  
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +

  # the stuff below is the same as before, except the plot title
  # scale_color_distiller(palette = "PuRd") +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = c("green3", "deepskyblue4", "royalblue4", "darkorchid4"), name = "Years Active") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1980, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1) +
  annotate(geom="text", x = 1800, y = 2, label="St. Helen's ->", color="red", size = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(linetype = "dashed", color = "grey85"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey80")
    # ,
    # panel.grid.major.y = element_line()
  ) +
  labs(x = "Years", y = "", title = "Volcano activity, ordered by year")

ggsave("Volcano_activity.png", height = 6, width = 6)
```

#### R colors
```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("https://www.datanovia.com/en/wp-content/uploads/dn-tutorials/ggplot2/figures/029-r-color-palettes-rcolorbrewer-palettes-colorblind-friendly-1.png") # Palettes

knitr::include_graphics("https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/img/colorbynames.png") # Specific colors

```


#### Joining datasets
```{r}

# join events data


# -----summarizing----


# let's join datasets: adding the newly summarized 'number of eruptions' to the dataset


# what are some other neat variables here? 
# we have latitude/longitute!



# cheat :) 
vol_coords <- sf::st_as_sf(vol_joined, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
                 crs = 4326, agr = "constant") # this code might be helpful later! 


# plot

# congrats, you've plotted your first (kinda) map! It's missing a lot... we'll get there in a bit


# one more thing- let's find the most active volcano and add a notation to the plot!
super_vol <- vol_coords %>% 
  filter(freq == max(freq)) # oh cool, this is Mount Etna in Italy

# cheat :)
ggplot(vol_coords) +
  geom_sf(aes(size = freq, color = freq)) +
  geom_sf(data = super_vol, size = 4, color = "darkorange") +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 10)) + # add guide = none after!
  # scale_size(range = c(1, 10), guide = "none") + # add guide = none after!
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_continuous() +
  facet_wrap(~major_rock_1, ncol = 2) 

# some more cool formatting options
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, color = "grey80", fill = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = vol_coords, aes(size = freq, color = freq)) +
  geom_sf(data = super_vol, size = 5, color = "black") +
  geom_sf(data = super_vol, size = 4, color = "cyan2") +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 10), guide = "none") + # add guide = none after!
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  theme_dark() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey10", color = "orange", linewidth = 4),
    plot.title = element_text(vjust = -10, hjust = 0.5, color = "cyan2")
  ) +
  labs(color = "Frequency", title = "Awesome volcano graph")
  

# ----ggplot as an object-----

#### The official R Graph Gallery
https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html 
Showcases different plot types for different data viz needs


### Spatial Data - Intro
You can find some great tutorials here: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/RProgDA/mapping.html

#### Load some basic data
```{r CRS Info}

# Read in vector data from spData package
data("world")

# Check the class of the object



#Simple features are a standard for the exchange of spatial feature data, meaning points, lines and polygons (and not e.g. vector topology, networks, or rasters). 

# Check the CRS of the data using st_crs() command



# Take a peak into the data set:



# some of the classes we see: characters, dbls (numbers), and multipolygon (geometric shape that consists of multiple connected polygons)... we'll touch on that in a bit
     


# get column headers 


```

In the `world` dataset the `head()` command returns the "simple feature dialogue"; it tells you what kind of "geometry" you are dealing with, the Geodetic CRS, and how many "fields" or attributes you have linked to each polygon.

Now let's do a quick visualization:
#### Quick Viz
```{r world plot}

# The default plot of an sf object is a multi-plot of all attributes, up to a reasonable maximum:
plot(world)
# so this takes that column of multipolygons, and says, ok- I know what the geographic outline is of each country or 

# what are the headers of each of the plots?


# can we plot just one column?



# the `geometry` column is the key feature here! The tidyverse world works well with `sf` in that it "sticks" the geometry column to whatever it is you subset by, however just calling with the dollar sign cut's out the geometry column, so it doesn't know how to plot it.

# we can choose which column to plot by indexing, which maintains the association with the 'sticky geometry':



# how does R know the shapes of continents if I only selected continent name?



```

#### ggplot
ggplot has theme presets that give your plots different set appearances (which can also be further modified). More info here: https://ggplot2-book.org/themes
```{r}

# Now with ggplot, for ease of formatting!






# you can even re-project on the fly while plotting:
map1 + coord_sf(crs = "+proj=laea +lat_0=52 +lon_0=10 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m") +
  ggtitle("World countries, but make it round")
    

# The function coord_sf allows to deal with the coordinate system, which includes both projection and extent of the map. By default, the map will use the coordinate system of the first layer that defines one (i.e. scanned in the order provided), or if none, fall back on WGS84 (latitude/longitude, the reference system used in GPS). Using the argument crs, it is possible to override this setting, and project on the fly to any projection. This can be achieved using any valid PROJ4 string (here, the European-centric ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection)
```


#### Selecting spatial data and patchwork
```{r}

# Assuming Antarctica is part of the dataset and you want to remove it
world_filtered <- world[world$continent != "Antarctica", ]
# see that now dataset has 176 rows instead of 177

notfiltered <- ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = continent)) +
  #theme_bw() +
  coord_sf(expand = FALSE) + # this is a product of spatial plotting... just define your y-axis
  #scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-80, 80)) +
  ggtitle("World Continents") +
  labs(fill = "Continents")

notfiltered


filtered <- ggplot(data = world_filtered) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = continent)) +
  #theme_bw() +
  coord_sf(expand = FALSE) +
  #scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-80, 80)) +
  ggtitle("World Continents - filtered") +
  labs(fill = "Continents") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # removing legend so that it doesn't appear twice

filtered


# using patchwork to plot together
(notfiltered / filtered) + plot_layout(guides = "collect") # see what happens to the legend when you delete "plot_layout()"


# let's make a quick regression plot
reg <- ggplot(world, aes(x = log(pop), y = log(area_km2))) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  # xlim(0, 100000000) +
  # ylim(0, 1000000) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  labs(x = "Population", y = bquote('Area '(Km^2)))

reg
# ======================================
# Now, compiled plots!

# we use the package {patchwork} to compile multiple figures into composite plots
  # use intuitive, "algebra-like" structure to group or organize
  # use "+" or "|" for side by side placement
  # and "/" for one panel above another
  # use ( ) to group plots together into a panel; e.g., (A + B) / C
  # use plot_spacer() as a placeholder, an easy way to fill empty spots to help construct your final plot

notfiltered + filtered
notfiltered / filtered
((notfiltered + filtered) + plot_layout(guides = "collect")) / reg
#((notfiltered / filtered) + plot_layout(guides = "collect")) / reg

((notfiltered + filtered) + plot_layout(guides = "collect")) / 
  (reg + plot_spacer())

# plot_spacer() helps as a placeholder for constructing your combined plots

((reg + plot_spacer() + reg) / 
  (plot_spacer() + reg + plot_spacer())) + plot_layout(guides = "collect")
 
# yikes, let's get rid of the legends
reg2 <- reg + theme(legend.position = "none") # and you can add some ggplot mods that will apply to all of the plots!

# and let's try again
(reg2 + plot_spacer() + reg2) / 
  (plot_spacer() + reg2 + plot_spacer())


```

#### Selecting spatial data
```{r}

# I want to only include the U.S. but is it called U.S.? United States? United States of America?
# let's check what the entries are
world$name_long # ah! this is a messy list...
sort(world$name_long) # note that this doesn't actually save the dataset columns in the sorted order- just returns a list of the columns headers, that it then sorts and spits out to you in order

# now we can select the U.S. polygon only, using indexing
us <- world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "United States")
  # filter(continent == "Europe")

# view(us) # woot! 

ggplot(data = us) +
  # geom_sf() +
  # geom_sf(color = "skyblue4") +
  geom_sf(color = "saddlebrown", fill = "tan1", linewidth = 0.8) +
  theme_bw() +
  #coord_sf(expand = FALSE) +
  #scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-80, 80)) +
  ggtitle("United States") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```


#### Geocoding
You can use existing search engines to look for addresses. You used to be able to do this with a package that tapped Google searchers, but Google now requires an API (a developer key) to allow these searchers... it's a process... Instead, we'll use a package that queries from Open Street Map (OSM).
read more here: https://rdrr.io/cran/tmaptools/man/geocode_OSM.html
```{r}

# let's look at some cities
cities <- tibble(city = c("London", "New York", "Santa Barbara"))

# and now let's ask for their coordinates
geocities <- geocode_OSM(cities$city)



# you can also use this to code a specific address! 
address <- geocode_OSM("522 University Dr, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106") 

# class(address) # [1] "list
# hmm... this doesn't help me... 


address <- geocode_OSM("522 University Dr, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106", as.data.frame = T) 
class(address$coords) # these coordinates are not actually geocoded- they are numbers

address <- geocode_OSM("522 University Dr, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106", as.data.frame = T) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326) # remember to always give longitutde first (x), then latitude (y)

# does this plot as a map?
ggplot(data = address) +
  #geom_sf(data = world) +
  geom_sf(color = "darkred", size = 6) +
  geom_sf(color = "red", size = 4) # not quite... need to add a world map to give it some contex

ggplot(data = address) +
  geom_sf(data = world) +
  geom_sf(color = "darkred", size = 6) +
  geom_sf(color = "red", size = 4) +
  geom_sf(data = vol_coords, color = "darkorange") # data from earlier!

# you can then limit the axes to zoom in to the region of interest

```

### Your Exercise:
Produce a combined figure using the volcanos, eruptions, and/or events dataset (one, two, or all three)

Your figure should include:
* one plot that represents non-spatial data (regression, boxplot, histogram, density or violin plot, columns, etc)
* one map that includes data other than just coordinates (e.g., not just where all the cities in Japan are on map, but, say, their population size too)
* a concise title
* Easy to understand axis labels
* a written figure caption

With the following parameters:
* change the default ggplot colors
* change the default ggplot theme (themes are plot appearances: background and text colors)
* combine multiple plots using patchwork

Something to consider: what is the story you want to tell? 
* why are you joining these figures? do the different panels of the plot correspond to one another? 
* how does order of plots help your narrative?
* how are your color choices, axis limits, titles, and other parameters helping you tell your story?



### BONUS
#### tmap (interactive!)
tmap is specifically designed for thematic maps and works very intuitively with sf objects. To create a simple world map:

Cool stuff with tmaps:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html

```{r}

tm_shape(world) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(title = "World Map") # use this like ggplot's "theme()"

# and with tmap
tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons("continent") +
  tm_layout(title = "World map, in color")

# this is much closer to a publication-ready map
# The tmap package makes it easy to visualize sf objects in R. It’s far more elegant than the other options I’ve shown you and makes creating interactive maps very simple.

tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons("continent") +
  tm_layout(title = "World Map",
            title.position = c("left", "top"),
            # legend.position = c("left", "bottom") # LB is default; # "right", "center", "left" and "top", "bottom"
            # legend.outside = TRUE,
            # legend.outside.position = "bottom"
            ) 

# continuous color scale
tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons("lifeExp")


# and you can switch to an interactive version!!!
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons("lifeExp", alpha = 0.7, palette = "-Spectral") 
# +
  # tm_polygons(alpha = 0.7) +
  # tm_bubbles("pop", size = "pop")
    
# **tmaps are also interactive in knitted documents**
# to return to regular plotting for publications:
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons("lifeExp", alpha = 0.7, palette = "-Spectral") 

```
